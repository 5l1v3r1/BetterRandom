# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of BetterRandom will be supported, unless and until a paying customer requests updates to a specific older version with which the current version is not backward-compatible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Coordinated disclosure is organized by [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/security) according to their policy.

If a vulnerability arises in a library and can be fixed by updating that library, it can be reported publicly, since some robots already do this.
